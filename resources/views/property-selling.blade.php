            <h4>Customer Profiling</h4>
            <p>While they say that a good salesperson is one who can sell a comb to a bald person, the same does not apply to all aspects of selling. At Squarefeets, we strongly believe in offering the inventory only to those who have a matching requirement. We ask the right questions to the prospective buyer to understand what he needs, so that we can offer them accordingly. This saves time and harassment for both the buyer as well as the seller, and the turnaround time is much quicker.</p>

            <h4>Price Setting</h4>
            <p>Often, Sellers expect the Realtor to guide them with the right price point at which they should look to sell their property. In setting the price, we make an effort into deriving the right price point through a data-driven approach. We analyze comparable sales and market conditions to establish a competitive yet realistic price point. This strategy aims to attract serious offers while ensuring you receive optimal value for your property. </p>
